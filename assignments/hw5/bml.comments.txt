BML Results/Comments ("Warning!: Questions can't be answered COMPLETELY until larger study simulations are done on Monday in the Statistics Computer Lab")

1. For what values of p, the density of the grid, did you find free flowing traffic and traffic jams? Did you find any cases of a mixture of jams and free flowing traffic?

  *Based on a simpler simpulation run of stepsize = 5000, and a runsize of 50 with a 15x15 matrix, the value of p that resulted in traffic jams (described as steps until gridlock < 5000), almost strictly were pvals of 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1. Conversely the pvals of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 almost were entirely traffic free (described as steps until gridlock = 5000). The mixtures of both jams and free flowing traffic were with the pval of 0.5. The pval of 0.0 was not checked for trivial reasons.

2. How many simulation steps did you need to run before observing this behavior?

  *Need Larger Studies

3. Does the transition depend on the size or shape of the grid?

  *Nedd Larger Studies
