1. For what values of p, the density of the grid, did you find free flowing traffic and traffic jams? Did you find any cases of a mixture of jams and free flowing traffic?

  Based on a simpler simpulation run of stepsize = 5000, and a runsize of 50 with a 15x15 matrix, the value of p that resulted in traffic jams (described as steps until gridlock < 5000), almost strictly were pvals of 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1. Conversely the pvals of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 almost were entirely traffic free (described as steps until gridlock = 5000). The mixtures of both jams and free flowing traffic were with the pval of 0.5. The pval of 0.0 was not checked for trivial reasons.

2. How many simulation steps did you need to run before observing this behavior?

  When we viewed the graphs for steps sizes of 5 to 15 for the 15x15 matrix with a p-value of 0.5 and compared it to our first graph's pval = 0.5 boxplot, we observed that the distributions did not resemble each other until the runsize hit 14. For the pval = 0.7, the distinction is even harder to analyze, but the behavior mirrored that of the first figure(bml_figures1.pdf) around a stepsize of 12. However, the true step size behavior would be better off analyzing with greater step sizes.

3. Does the transition depend on the size or shape of the grid?

  The size or shape of the grid does seem to make an impact of the overall distribution of the graphs for both p-values and runsizes. When comparing teh p-value distribution for both the 5x5 and 15x15 matrix, we see that the behavior of the 5x5 pval = 0.5 run is traffic free, instead of being a mix in the 15x15 run. Additionally, both p-values of 0.6 and 0.7 for the 5x5 matrix were much more mixed in terms of traffic, whereas the 0.6 and 0.7 p-values of the 15x15 matrix were much more defined as a traffic jam.
  This behavior is mirrored in the 5x5 p = 0.5 case for runsize, where regardless of run, most of the observations were viewed as traffic free. The similar case for the 15x15 matrix does not show the same behavior. It is much more mixed, with most runsizes tending towards lower steps until gridlock, just like in the first graph (bml_figures1.pdf).
